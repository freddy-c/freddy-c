Hi there 👋

I'm Freddy, a recent **Computer Science BSc graduate** from [Durham University](https://durham.ac.uk/), passionate about technology, software engineering, and continuous learning. I love building efficient, reliable systems and thinking deeply about algorithms and distributed computing.

- 🔭 **Recently completed:** My independent research project,  
  **"Optimizing Round Complexity of Energy-Efficient Distributed MST Algorithms"**,  
  including an implementation repo: [Awake Complexity of Distributed Minimum Spanning Tree](https://github.com/freddy-c/Awake-Complexity-of-Distributed-Minimum-Spanning-Tree).

- 🌱 **Academic interests:** Cryptography, Algorithmic Game Theory, Deep Learning, and Distributed Algorithms — explored through my final-year modules and projects.

- 👨‍💻 **Experience:**  
  - Led a team in a university–industry collaboration with **IBM**  
  - Built a **real-time data analytics dashboards**  
  - Developed full-stack apps using **Next.js** and **TimescaleDB**

- 🎯 **Projects:**  
  - [Shortest Vector Problem Solver](https://github.com/freddyc2003/svp) – experimentation with lattice-based problems  
  - [Awake Complexity of Distributed Minimum Spanning Tree](https://github.com/freddy-c/Awake-Complexity-of-Distributed-Minimum-Spanning-Tree) – research-driven distributed algorithms project

- 💬 **Ask me about:**  
  Software engineering, distributed algorithms, algorithmic optimisation, or how to balance focused work with outdoor fun (I’ve also worked as a **high ropes instructor** and love being outside!).
