Hi there 👋

I'm Freddy, a recent **Computer Science BSc graduate** from [Durham University](https://durham.ac.uk/), passionate about technology, software engineering, and continuous learning. I love building efficient, reliable systems and thinking deeply about algorithms and distributed computing.

- 🔭 **Recently completed:** My independent research project, **"Optimizing Round Complexity of Energy-Efficient Distributed MST Algorithms"**, including an implementation repo: [Awake Complexity of Distributed Minimum Spanning Tree](https://github.com/freddy-c/Awake-Complexity-of-Distributed-Minimum-Spanning-Tree).

- 🌱 **Academic interests:** Cryptography, Algorithmic Game Theory, Deep Learning, and Distributed Algorithms — explored through my final-year modules and projects.

- 👨‍💻 **Experience:**
  - Freelance Web Developer – building and maintaining marketing sites for local businesses in WordPress, from initial consultation and design through to deployment and ongoing support.
  - Full-Stack Developer @ NGen Group – developed interactive real-time analytics dashboards using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and an ASP.NET Core API, optimising queries over large PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB time-series datasets for fast visualisations.

- 🎯 **Projects:**  
  - [Shortest Vector Problem Solver](https://github.com/freddyc2003/svp) – experimentation with lattice-based problems  
  - [Awake Complexity of Distributed Minimum Spanning Tree](https://github.com/freddy-c/Awake-Complexity-of-Distributed-Minimum-Spanning-Tree) – research-driven distributed algorithms project
  - [Spray Application Calculator](https://github.com/freddy-c/spray-calculator) – full-stack React/Next.js/TypeScript app with PostgreSQL and Prisma — a golf course spray application calculator for managing equipment settings, nozzle configurations, and treatment area planning

- 💬 **Ask me about:**  
  Software engineering, distributed algorithms, algorithmic optimisation, or how to balance focused work with outdoor fun (I've also worked as a **high ropes instructor** and love being outside!).
